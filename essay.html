        <p>Yorkville is one of New York’s more quiet neighborhoods, filled more with residential buildings than high-rise office spaces and trendy restaurants. For me, it’s always been sort of a small town rather than a part of the world’s largest city. The constant movement and jumble of strangers is replaced by almost-empty sidewalks with friends who run into each other so often they may as well be neighbors. On 81st Street, there’s a small ice cream parlor that embodies that feeling of community known as Emack and Bolio’s.</p>
<p>The things I see on the walls as I walk in and look around the store have remained unchanged since I was four years old. The pictures of the owner with some of history’s greatest rockstars, the various awards the store has won, and the magnets representing each exclusive, outside-the-box flavor and its quirky name, with a cartoon to match. For a place that started in a basement and was named after two homeless men, it cleaned up nicely. And behind the counter, there is always a familiar face that smiles when they see me. When I was younger, it was Jarrad, the son of the owner, who gave me the impression of a laid-back hippie, but was a hardworking businessman dedicated to carrying on his father’s legacy. Nowadays it’s Simon, the store manager, who is always curious about how my parents and I are doing, and knows what I’m going to order without even having to ask: Grasshopper Pie, or as it’s more commonly known, mint chocolate chip. It’s the only flavor I’ve ever gotten from there, but I’m sure none of the others could ever top it.
I would go there almost every other day while I lived in that neighborhood and fill up the “buy 10, get the 11th free” cards in less than two weeks. Granted, getting there wasn’t as hard as crossing a desert without supplies, as it was right around the corner from my apartment, but the short distance was all the more reason to go there as often as possible.</p>
<p>As highly as I speak of Emack and Bolio’s, it’s a place that most New Yorkers will walk right by without even stopping to see what it has to offer. They probably pass many more similar places every day, yet as soon as their eye catches a McDonald’s or Taco Bell, they become a paperclip being pulled toward a magnet. But from the perspective of the owner of the small antique shop across the street from a Starbucks, or the man who opened a bagel store fifty years ago only for a Dunkin’ Donuts to come along and take all his customers, watching the potential patrons glance inside only to see the bigger, more recognizable chain just a few steps away is an arduous task. It also makes their eyes brighten that much more when a familiar face, who has come into the store frequently for years, walks in.
To the people who are coming through the door, these small shops represent everything positive about their community. Whatever their connection to the store may be, and however recently their first visit may have been, it has touched them enough that they want to come whenever they have the chance, believing that it will ensure that it makes the same impact on others in the years, or possibly generations, to come. But the people behind these stores do not take the role that they have been given for granted: it makes them more willing to serve the people who take time out of their day to give them their support. New York is full of small businesses, each with a different history and culture, but the same unwavering devotion to their loyal customers and community.</p>
<p>I lived on the Upper East Side for the majority of my childhood, and I would need more than just ten fingers to count how many places there that I remember fondly. I could say the outdoor exhibit of abstract statues that I treated as a playground, or Carl Schurz Park, where I would take long walks with my family or just sit and relax on a field, or even my elementary school are the places that define the neighborhood for me. But instead, Emack and Bolio’s is the most cherished remnant of my youth. For so many years, I have been the loyal customer that puts a wide smile on the employees’ faces when I saunter in through the door, and I always find myself returning the favor. Because for me, a stop at Emack and Bolio’s isn’t just to grab a sweet treat and make any worries go away for a little while; it’s a chance to reconnect with old friends that I know will always welcome me inside their ice cream haven.</p>
